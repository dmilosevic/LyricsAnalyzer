There are two important things to remember 
about learning any new language
one, be interested in the people
their country and language
want to learn it

Two, practice it as often as you can
nothing is more effective 
than creating a friendly atmosphere
and nothing flatters people more 
than when a foreigner 
tries to speak their language

Remember, knowing the language 
is the best way of knowing the country 
and enjoying it more
